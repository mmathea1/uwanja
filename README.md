# Uwanja — Classroom Management & Parent Communication

Uwanja is a web-based classroom management platform originally built as my university final-year project.
It helps primary school teachers manage student information, track activities, and communicate with parents — using one simple dashboard.

The platform integrates with mobile apps and chatbot interfaces used by students and parents, so everyone stays aligned without relying on scattered diaries and WhatsApp messages.

## Why I Built This

In many schools, teachers juggle notebooks, paper attendance sheets, WhatsApp groups, and printed letters.
Important information gets lost — and parents only hear about issues when it’s already too late.

Uwanja explores whether a single digital classroom system can:

- organize classroom information

- improve teacher–parent communication

- reduce paper waste

- support students more consistently
